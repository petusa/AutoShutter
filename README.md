# AutoShutter

A tiny helper applicaiton that lets you remotely start a continous shooting from the Sony Remote Camera Control app.

The basic motivation behind the app is that the official Sony Remote Camera Conrol lacks the feature remotely capturing in continous shooing mode without the presence of a real person, who presses and keeps holding the shutter button on the app. 

The AutoShutter resolves this problem via programatically triggering a press and hold action on the shutter button after waiting 3 seconds.  

## What does the application do?

The app only has a Start/Stop button, which is whenever pressed the Sony Remote Camera application's capture button will be pressed automatically. So no one needs to hold the capture button pressed while shooting in continous mode.
